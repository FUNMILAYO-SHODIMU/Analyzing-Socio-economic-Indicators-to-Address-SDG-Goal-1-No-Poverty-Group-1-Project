## Project Overview
- Analyzing Socio-economic Indicators to Address SDG Goal 1: No Poverty Group 1 Project

  Poverty remains a critical challenge worldwide, deeply intertwined with issues such as healthcare, education and economic opportunities. 
SDG 1 aims to end poverty in all its forms world wide by 2030 through holistic approach to improving economic stability, reducing inequalities and enhancing quality of life to create a world free of poverty. By taking a data-driven approach, this project aims to: 
   - Analyze socio-economic factors (income, literacy, healthcare access)
   - Identify key poverty drivers and regional disparities
   - Propose data-driven recommendations for effective povertyÂ alleviation.


- In this group project, I played the role as the team lead for 30 women, I took the responsibility for coordinating and managing both the people and our project from ideation to execution,leveraged skills in Project Management, team collaboration, communication, leadership and general soft skills. Also, I leveraged my skills in AI prompt to generate a dataset for SDG 1 by telling my objectives to ChatGPT using the appropriate prompt.

 - This is a group project for Group 1, Data for Impact Analytics Women Techsters BootCamp for Cohort 3 Y2024, an initiative of Tech4dev. Using advanced data analytics, we designed a dashboard to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions. SDG 1 aims to end poverty in all its forms worldwide by 2030.

## Data Source

I leveraged my skills in AI prompt to generate a dataset for SDG 1: No Poverty, by telling my objectives to ChatGPT using the appropriate prompt.


## Tools Used

-  Excel for data cleaning 
-  Power BI for data visualization

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

- The data type was transformed to describe the data contained in each column.
- We introduced a new column to group the countries by their continents.
- For missing years in each country, we introduced an average aggregations using the available data in past years.
- We checked for data consistency, accuracy, completion and all data are valid and relevant.

## Conclusion

- The data reveals significant disparities in poverty rates, literacy rates, child mortality rates, and life expectancy across different regions and years. 
- Turkey and South America are notable for their high poverty and literacy rates respectively, while North America leads in income per capita. 
- The year 2019 stands out due to the significant divergence between child mortality and poverty rates. 
- Additionally, there's a clear negative correlation between poverty rates and child mortality rates, indicating that as poverty increases, child mortality tends to rise. 
- The analysis of life expectancy and healthcare access also shows notable variations, with 2022 having the highest life expectancy and 2020 showing the greatest divergence between life expectancy and healthcare access.

## Recommendations

- Targeted Poverty Alleviation Programs: Focused interventions should be implemented in regions with high poverty rates, to reduce poverty and improve living conditions.
- Enhance Literacy Initiatives: Strengthening literacy programs in regions with lower literacy rates, particularly in Asia and Africa, to bridge the educational gap.
- Improve Healthcare Services: Investment in healthcare infrastructure and access, to reduce child mortality and improve overall health outcomes.
- Economic Development Strategies: Adoption and adaptation of economic policies that have been successful in regions with high income per capita, like North America, to boost income levels in other regions as well as policies aimed at reducing income disparities to promote more equitable economic growth.

## Limitations

The data used for the analysis was sourced from ChatGPT, which may not be entirely up-to-date or comprehensive. Also, the analysis relied on historical and descriptive data, predictive modelling techniques such as machine learning were not implemented due to time constraints.
